# COG PM FRONTEND

### REPO RULES🚨🚨🚨
- ALWAYS build (i.e `npm run build` or `yarn build`) your code before you push to this repo, to prevent deployment errors👍🏾
- Don't edit the setup files without general permission (i.e .eslintrc.json, .prettierrc, .prettierignore, .vscode files, .husky files)
- All files should be in `.js` not `.jsx` to encourage consistency
- The main styling for this website is "TailwindCSS", adhere from creating more `.scss` and `.css`("Use `globals.css" for your custom css)
- Create files in using the right NextJS folder structure routing. If you're not sure, here [Read it here...](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing)
- Utility function should be created in the `utils` folder(preferrably in its `index.js` file)
- The `temp` folder is just "temporary" code for reference purposes, may be deleted soon
- Use the import alias (i.e `@`) wherever you can to avoid import chaining (i.e "../../" or "../../") and so on😣
- Components should be capitilized to encourage consistency (i.e `Component.js` not `component.js`)
- Do not tamper with the current structure of the project (e.g creating new folders in the root directory) without general permission
- Do not tamper with config files without general permission (i.e `next.config.js`, `jsconfig.json`, `postcss.config.js`) except `tailwind.config.js`😉

  #### PS: "General permission" means permission from either [Tobi](https://github.com/tobiadetunji5) or [Leye](https://github.com/usernameisleye) or 2+ fellow developers or all
